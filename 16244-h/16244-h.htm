<h2>THE PLEASANTRIES OF COGIA NASR EDDIN EFENDI</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A breeze, which pleasant stories bears,<br />
Relicks of long departed years.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story goes, one of the stories of a hundred, that Cogia Nasr
Eddin Efendi one day ascending into the pulpit to preach, said, &lsquo;O
believers, do ye not know what I am going to say to you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
The congregation answered, &lsquo;Dear Cogia Efendi, we do not know.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then said the Cogia, &lsquo;What shall I say to you until you do know?&rsquo;&nbsp;
One day the Cogia ascending again into the pulpit, said, &lsquo;O Mussulmen,
do ye not know what I am going to say to you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We
do know,&rsquo; they replied.&nbsp; Then said the Cogia, &lsquo;Some
of ye do know already, what should I have to say to you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then descending from the chair he went out.&nbsp; The assembly separated
quite astonished, and, when they were out, continued to say, &lsquo;Which
are those of us who know?&nbsp; Which are those who do not know?&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Cogia one day again mounting the chair in the same manner, said,
&lsquo;O brothers, when I said to ye, &ldquo;Do you know what I shall
say?&rdquo; there were some who said, &ldquo;We know,&rdquo; others
said, &ldquo;We do not.&rdquo;&nbsp; It were now well that those among
ye who knew what the Cogia said should teach those that did not.&rsquo;
<!-- page 254--><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span></p>
<p>One day Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi said, &lsquo;O Mussulmen, give thanks
to God Most High that He did not give the camel wings; for, had He given
them, they would have perched upon your houses and chimneys, and have
caused them to tumble upon your heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi having mounted the chair in a city,
said, &lsquo;O Mussulmen, the air above this city is just like the air
above my city.&rsquo;&nbsp; The congregation said, &lsquo;O Cogia Efendi,
how do you know that?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;Because I
have seen as many stars above this city as I saw above Belgrade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One night the Cogia dreamt that he was given nine aspres, whereupon
the Cogia said, &lsquo;O now pray make them up ten&rsquo;; afterwards
he said, &lsquo;Make them up eleven,&rsquo; and then presently, a dispute
having arisen, he awoke and saw that in his hand he had nothing, thereupon
closing his eyes anew and stretching out his hands, he said, &lsquo;Well,
well, I shall be content with nine aspres.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia went out into the plain, and as he was going along
he suddenly saw some men on horseback coming towards him.&nbsp; Cogia
Efendi, in a great hurry, set off towards a cemetery, and having reached
it took off his clothes, and entering into a tomb lay down.&nbsp; The
horsemen, on seeing the Cogia run away, followed him to the place where
he lay, and said, &lsquo;O fellow, <!-- page 255--><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>why
do you lie here?&rsquo;&nbsp; Cogia Efendi, finding nothing else to
say, replied, &lsquo;I am one of the buried people, but came here to
walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cogia Efendi one day went into a garden, pulled up some carrots and
turnips and other kinds of vegetables, which he found, putting some
into a sack and some into his bosom; suddenly the gardener coming up,
laid hold of him, and said, &lsquo;What are you seeking here?&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Cogia, being in great consternation, not finding any other reply,
answered, &lsquo;For some days past a great wind has been blowing, and
that wind blew me hither.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But who pulled up these
vegetables?&rsquo; said the gardener.&nbsp; &lsquo;As the wind blew
very violently,&rsquo; replied the Cogia, &lsquo;it cast me here and
there, and whatever I laid hold of in the hope of saving myself remained
in my hands.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the gardener, &lsquo;but
who filled the sack with them?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said
the Cogia, &lsquo;that is the very question I was about to ask myself
when you came up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Cogia Efendi, on whom God be merciful, went to the city of
Conia, and going into a pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop, seized hold of a tart,
and saying, &lsquo;In the Name of God,&rsquo; began to eat it.&nbsp;
The pastry-cook cried out, &lsquo;Halloa, fellow, what are you about?&rsquo;
and fell to beating him.&nbsp; The Cogia said, &lsquo;Oh what a fine
country is this of Conia, in which, whilst a man eats a tart, they put
in a blow as a digester for every morsel.&rsquo; <!-- page 256--><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span></p>
<p>Cogia Nasr Eddin, at the time of the Holy Ramadan, thought to himself,
&lsquo;What must I do in order to hold the fast in conformity with the
people?&nbsp; I must prepare an earthen pot, and every day put a stone
into it, and when thirty days are completed I may hold my Beiram.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So he commenced placing stones in the pot, one every day.&nbsp; Now
it happened one day that a daughter of the Cogia cast a handful of stones
into the pot, and a little time after some people asked the Cogia, &lsquo;What
day of the month is it to-day?&rsquo;&nbsp; Now it happened to be the
twenty-fifth.&nbsp; The Cogia, however, said to them, &lsquo;Have patience
and I will see&rsquo;; and going to his house and emptying the pot,
perceived that there were a hundred and twenty stones in it.&nbsp; Says
the Cogia to himself, &lsquo;If I tell the people all this number they
will call me a fool.&rsquo;&nbsp; So going to them he said, &lsquo;This
day is the forty-fifth day of the month.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, said they,
&lsquo;O Cogia, a month has in all but thirty days, so how can you say
that to-day is the forty-fifth?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I spoke quite within
bounds,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you were to see the account
in the pot you would find that to-day is the hundred and twentieth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia was asked, &lsquo;When there is a new moon, what
becomes of the old one?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;They make forty stars out
of each,&rsquo; said the Cogia.</p>
<p>One day the Cogia went out of the city along with a cafila or caravan
of people, and felt a <!-- page 257--><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>wish
to ride.&nbsp; Now there was a camel belonging to the cafila, and the
Cogia said to himself, &lsquo;Now, if instead of walking I should mount
on this camel, how comfortably could I travel!&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon
mounting on the camel, he proceeded along with the cafila.&nbsp; The
camel, however, falling to kicking, flung the Cogia to the earth and
knelt upon him.&nbsp; The Cogia cried out loudly, and the people of
the cafila came and rescued him.&nbsp; After a little time the Cogia,
coming to his senses, said, &lsquo;O Mussulmen, did you not see how
that perfidious camel maltreated me?&nbsp; Now do hold the perfidious
brute for me, that I may cut its throat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia bought a quantity of eggs at the rate of nine for
the aspre, and carrying them to another place, he sold them at the rate
of ten.&nbsp; Some people asking him, &lsquo;Why do you sell ten for
what you gave for nine?&rsquo; the Cogia replied, &lsquo;I always wish
my friends to see that I lose by my bargains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia walking along the plain met a heifer, and forthwith
laying thievish hands upon it, led it straight to his house, where he
slaughtered it and stripped off the skin.&nbsp; The proprietor soon
appeared before the Cogia&rsquo;s house, making a loud cry and lamentation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who would have thought,&rsquo; said the Cogia to his people and
his wife, &lsquo;that my flaying the heifer would have made that fellow&rsquo;s
face look so black?&rsquo; <!-- page 258--><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span></p>
<p>One day the Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi passing along the bazaar, an
individual coming up to him said, &lsquo;Pray, Cogia, what is the moon
to-day?&nbsp; Is it at three or four?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;I neither buy nor sell the
moon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia taking a ladder on his shoulder, placed it against
a garden wall, and mounting, got over, taking the ladder with him.&nbsp;
The gardener seeing him said, &lsquo;Who are you? and what do you want
here?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am come to sell this ladder,&rsquo; said
the Cogia without hesitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is this a place for selling
a ladder?&rsquo; said the gardener.&nbsp; &lsquo;O you foolish man,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;cannot a ladder be sold anywhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nasr Eddin Efendi one day taking hold of some fowls one by one, tied
some strips of an apron round their throats, and then let them go.&nbsp;
The learned men having assembled round the Cogia, said, &lsquo;What
was the matter with these fowls?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;They
merely went into mourning for their slaughtered mothers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day a bull mounted a young cow of the Cogia&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
Cogia seeing what he was about, took a staff in his hand and ran towards
him.&nbsp; The bull fled towards the car of a Turcoman, to which seven
other oxen were attached.&nbsp; The Cogia keeping the ox in view, ran
after him, and with the staff in his hand struck the ox several blows.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Halloa, man!&rsquo; said the Turcoman. <!-- page 259--><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>
&lsquo;What do you want with my ox?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
you interfere, you foolish dog,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
knows full well what he has done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia made his last will.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I die,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;place me in an old tomb.&rsquo;&nbsp; When the people
about him said, &lsquo;Why do you make this request?&rsquo; the Cogia
said, &lsquo;When the inquiring angels come and ask me questions, I
can say, &ldquo;I am deaf.&nbsp; Do you not see that I as well as my
tomb am old?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Cogia Efendi, putting on very short habiliments, went to
the mosque to say his prayers.&nbsp; Whilst performing the rakoua the
man who was behind him perceiving the Cogia&rsquo;s --- seized hold
of them and squeezed them, whereupon the Cogia, seizing hold of those
of the man who was before him, squeezed them too; the man, turning round
and perceiving that it was Cogia Efendi himself, said, &lsquo;Halloa,
what are you about?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You must ask the man behind
me,&rsquo; said the Cogia.</p>
<p>One day the boys of Belgrade took the Cogia along with them into
the bath.&nbsp; They had secretly brought in their pouches a number
of eggs.&nbsp; One and all going into the bathing-house, took off their
clothes and went in, and then, sitting down on the bench, they all said
to one another, &lsquo;Come, let us lay eggs: whosoever does not lay
an egg shall pay the expenses of the bath&rsquo;; <!-- page 260--><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>after
which they began to make a great noise, cackling like hens, and flinging
the eggs which they had brought on the stone bench.&nbsp; Cogia Efendi,
seeing what they were about, suddenly began to make a great noise and
crow like a cock.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you about, Cogia Efendi?&rsquo;
said the boys.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is not a cock
necessary where there are so many hens?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia, putting on black clothes, went out.&nbsp; The
people, looking at him, said, &lsquo;Cogia Efendi, for whose death are
you in mourning?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia answered, &lsquo;My son&rsquo;s
father is dead, and I wear mourning for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Cogia, returning from the harvest field, felt very thirsty.&nbsp;
Looking around, he saw that they watered a tree by means of a pipe from
a fountain.&nbsp; The Cogia exclaimed, &lsquo;I must drink,&rsquo; and
pulled at the spout, and as he did so the water, spouting forth with
violence, wetted the mouth and head of the Cogia, who, in a great rage,
said, &lsquo;They watered this wretched tree in order that one fool
might wet another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia, taking some water melons with him, went to the
mountain in order to cut wood.&nbsp; Feeling thirsty, he cut one of
the melons, and, putting it to his mouth, cast it away, saying that
it was tasteless.&nbsp; He then cut up another, and, to be short, he
cut them all up, and, having <!-- page 261--><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>eaten
a little of each, made water over what remained.&nbsp; He then fell
to work at cutting wood.&nbsp; After some time the Cogia again became
thirsty, and finding no water, he went to the bits of the melons which
he had cut up, and saying, &lsquo;This is sprinkled, and this is sprinkled,&rsquo;
ate them all.</p>
<p>Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi had a lamb which he had fattened to a high
degree.&nbsp; One day some of his friends having assembled, said, &lsquo;Let
us get the lamb from the Cogia and feast upon it.&rsquo;&nbsp; So coming
to the Cogia as quick as possible, they said, &lsquo;O Cogia, to-morrow
is the Day of Judgment; what would you do with this lamb?&nbsp; Come,
take it, and let us eat it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia, however, would not
believe them.&nbsp; Coming again, however, they said the same thing,
and the Cogia, at last believing their words were true, slaughtered
the lamb, and, taking it on his back, he carried it to the public walk,
and, lighting a fire, he began to prepare a roast.&nbsp; Presently,
stripping their bodies, they delivered their clothes to the Cogia, and
each went aside to sleep.&nbsp; Whereupon the Cogia, taking their garments,
flung them all into the fire and burnt them.&nbsp; In a little time,
their bellies becoming hungry from the sleep they had had, they came
again, and saw that their garments were nearly reduced to a coal.&nbsp;
Whereupon they said to the Cogia, &lsquo;Who burnt our clothes?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;My dear friends,&rsquo; replied the Cogia, &lsquo;to-morrow is
the Day of Resurrection, so what need can you have of clothes?&rsquo;
<!-- page 262--><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span></p>
<p>One day a thief, entering the house of the Cogia, laid hold of everything
there was there, and, placing it on his back, went away.&nbsp; The Cogia,
however, spying somebody going out, followed the thief, who went into
his own house.&nbsp; The Cogia following close behind, pushed against
him at the door.&nbsp; Whereupon the thief said, &lsquo;What do you
want, Cogia Efendi?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do I want?&rsquo; said
the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, are we not going to remove hither to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day certain individuals stole from the Cogia a sum of money,
whereupon the Cogia said, &lsquo;O Lord, what need have you that you
give my money to others.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he made a dreadful outcry,
and going into the mosque, wept until it was morning, groaning like
a ship labouring in the sea.&nbsp; Those who were there said, &lsquo;Ye
who have found salvation make up a sum of money for the Cogia.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So whosoever had found salvation through the assistance of the Almighty
made up what he could, and brought it to the Cogia.&nbsp; Whereupon
the Cogia exclaimed, &lsquo;Allah, Allah! by lying one night publicly
in the mosque and weeping, I have caused Allah to send me my money again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia borrowed a cauldron of a brazier, and carrying
it home, put a little saucepan into it, and then carrying it back, returned
it to its owner.&nbsp; The owner seeing a little saucepan in the cauldron,
said, &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; <!-- page 263--><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; cried the Cogia, &lsquo;the cauldron has borne a
child&rsquo;; whereupon the owner took possession of the saucepan.&nbsp;
One day the Cogia asked again for the cauldron, and having obtained
it, carried it home.&nbsp; The owner of the cauldron waited one day
and even five days for his utensil, but no cauldron coming, he went
to the house of the Cogia and knocked at the door.&nbsp; The Cogia coming
to the door, said, &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
cauldron,&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, set your heart at rest,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;the cauldron is dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;O Cogia,&rsquo;
said the man, &lsquo;can a cauldron die?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;as you believed it could bear a child, why should
you not believe that it can die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia, walking amongst the sepulchres, saw a large dog
lying upon a gravestone.&nbsp; The Cogia, in a great rage laying hold
on a stick, aimed a blow at the dog, who in his turn assaulted the Cogia.&nbsp;
The Cogia fearing that he should be torn to pieces, said to the dog,
&lsquo;Get you gone: I conquered.&nbsp; Get you gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia laying hold on a crane, took it home, and saying
that its beak and feet were very long, cut them off with a knife; and
placing it on a lofty place, said, &lsquo;Now you look like a bird.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia having made his broth very hot, burnt his mouth,
and making a great outcry, <!-- page 264--><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>ran
into the street, saying, &lsquo;Make way, brothers: there is a fire
in my belly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Moolah, who had travelled about Arabia, Persia, Hindustan, and,
in a word, the whole seven climes without finding any one who could
answer his questions, was told by a man, &lsquo;In this country there
is a man called Cogia Nasr Eddin, who will answer your questions if
any one can.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Moolah arising, went straight to Belgrade,
where he bought an aspre&rsquo;s worth of pomegranates, which he placed
in his bosom.&nbsp; Going out of the suburbs of Belgrade, he saw a man
going to his labour; now this was the Cogia himself.&nbsp; Going up
to him he saw a man like a fakeah, with shoes of raw hide on his feet
and a kiebbeh or rough cloak on his back.&nbsp; When he was close by
him he said to him, &lsquo;Salaam&rsquo;; and the Cogia saying to him,
&lsquo;Peace be unto you,&rsquo; said, &lsquo;Moolah Efendi, for what
have you come?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Moolah replied, &lsquo;Can you answer
a question which I shall ask?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia said, &lsquo;I
can.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know so-and-so?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia
said, &lsquo;I can do nothing without being paid.&nbsp; What will you
give me?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Moolah taking the pomegranates which were
in his bosom, gave him one; whereupon the Cogia answered his question,
and got all his pomegranates, one by one, till not a single grain remained.&nbsp;
The Moolah then said, &lsquo;I have yet one question to ask.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Cogia replied, &lsquo;Go your way: don&rsquo;t trouble me.&nbsp;
The pomegranates are spent.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the Moolah went away,
saying, &lsquo;If the labourers of Moom <!-- page 265--><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>are
of this description, what must the learned men be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia saw a great many ducks playing on the top of a
fountain.&nbsp; The Cogia, running towards them, said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
catch you&rsquo;; whereupon they all rose up and took to flight.&nbsp;
The Cogia, taking a little bread in his hand, sat down on the side of
the fountain, and crumbling the bread in the fountain, fell to eating.&nbsp;
A person coming up, said, &lsquo;What are you eating?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Duck
broth,&rsquo; replied the Cogia.</p>
<p>One day the Cogia having bought a liver, was carrying it to his house;
suddenly a kite, swooping from above with a loud scream, seized the
liver, and flew off with it.&nbsp; The Cogia remained staring after
it, but saw that it was impossible to recover his meat.&nbsp; Making
up his mind, he ran up to the top of an eminence, and a person passing
below with a liver in his hand, the Cogia darted down and snatched the
liver out of the person&rsquo;s hand, and ran again up the rock.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hallo, Cogia,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;what are you about?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was merely playing the kite out of fun,&rsquo; said the Cogia.</p>
<p>A person coming to Nasr Eddin Efendi, requested him to let him have
a rope.&nbsp; The Cogia went into his house, and coming out again, said,
&lsquo;The rope is striking ten.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How can a rope
strike ten?&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will always be <!-- page 266--><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>striking
ten,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;till I feel inclined to give you
the rope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia put some fowls into a cage and set out for the
castle of Siouri.&nbsp; As he was going along he said to himself, &lsquo;These
poor wretches are here imprisoned: I think I may as well give them a
little liberty.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he let them all out, and all the hens
ran off in one direction or another.&nbsp; The Cogia taking a stick
in his hand, placed himself before the cock, pushing him and driving
him, saying, &lsquo;O you who in the middle of the night knowest when
it is morning, how is it that in broad day thou knowest not the way
to the castle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day as the Cogia was wandering amongst the tombs, by the side
of the way he fell into an old tomb, and making believe as if he were
dead, he said, &lsquo;Let me see Mounkhir.&nbsp; Is Nek&icirc;r coming?&rsquo;&nbsp;
As he lay there stretched at his length, it appeared to him that he
heard from afar the voice of a bell.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the noise of
the Day of Judgment,&rsquo; said the Cogia, and forthwith sprang out
of the tomb.&nbsp; Now it happened that a caravan was coming, and the
Cogia, by putting out his head, frightened the camels, who jostled each
other in great confusion.&nbsp; No sooner did the conductors see the
Cogia than, seizing their cudgels, they said to him, &lsquo;You!&nbsp;
Who are you?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia said to them, &lsquo;I am one who
is dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And what are you doing here?&rsquo; said
the conductors. <!-- page 267--><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>
&lsquo;I merely came to take a walk,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
will now make you take a pretty walk,&rsquo; said the carriers, and
instantly began belabouring him with their cudgels.&nbsp; The Cogia,
with tears streaming from his eyes, ran home.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where have
you been?&rsquo; said his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been dead,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;and in the tomb.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And what
is there in the other world?&rsquo; said his wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;provided you don&rsquo;t frighten carriers&rsquo;
camels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once upon a time the Cogia was sent into Curdistan along with the
Ambassador.&nbsp; Whilst he was there the Curdish Beys invited the Cogia
to a feast which they had made in honour of him.&nbsp; The Cogia, putting
on a pelisse, went to the place of festival.&nbsp; During the entertainment
he chanced to belch.&nbsp; &lsquo;You do wrong to belch, Cogia Moolah
Efendi,&rsquo; said the Beys.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am amongst Curds,&rsquo;
said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;How should they know a Turkish belching,
even though they hear it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia went with Cheragh Ahmed to the den of a wolf, in
order to see the cubs.&nbsp; Said the Cogia to Ahmed: &lsquo;Do you
go in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ahmed did so.&nbsp; The old wolf was abroad, but
presently returning, tried to get into the cave to its young.&nbsp;
When it was about half-way in the Cogia seized hard hold of it by the
tail.&nbsp; The wolf in its struggles cast a quantity of dust into the
eyes <!-- page 268--><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>of Ahmed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hallo, Cogia,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;what does this dust mean?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;If the wolf&rsquo;s tail breaks,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll
soon see what the dust means.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia mounted upon a tree, and, sitting upon a branch,
forthwith began to cut it.&nbsp; A person coming up said, &lsquo;Hallo,
man! what are you about? as soon as you have cut the branch you will
fall.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia made no answer, but went on cutting, and
no sooner had he cut through the bough than down fell the Cogia to the
ground.&nbsp; Getting up, he ran after the person, crying out, &lsquo;Ho,
fellow, if you knew that I should fall you also knew that I should kill
myself,&rsquo; and forthwith seized him by the collar.&nbsp; The man,
finding no other way to save himself, said, &lsquo;Leave hold of me
and fling yourself down on the road face upwards.&nbsp; At the first
belching that you give half your soul will leave your body; at the second,
all will go and not a particle will remain.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia did
so, and at the second belching, laying himself down on the ground, he
cried, &lsquo;I am dead,&rsquo; and remained motionless.&nbsp; Forthwith
the Ulemas hastened to him, and bringing with them a coffin, placed
him in it, saying, &lsquo;Let us carry him home.&rsquo;&nbsp; On their
way, coming to a miry place, they said, &lsquo;We will rest,&rsquo;
and began to talk together.&nbsp; The Cogia, forthwith raising his head
from the coffin, said, &lsquo;If I were alive I would get out of this
place as quick as possible.&rsquo; <!-- page 269--><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span></p>
<p>One day the Cogia set about making a stable under the earth.&nbsp;
As he was digging, he got into a stable of one of his neighbours, in
which he found several oxen.&nbsp; The Cogia, very much rejoiced, went
into his house, and said, &lsquo;O wife, I have found a stable of oxen;
a relic of the times of the Caffirs.&nbsp; Now what will you give me
for bringing you this piece of good news?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nasr Eddin Efendi had two daughters.&nbsp; One day the two coming
to see their father, the Cogia said to them, &lsquo;Well, daughters,
how do things go on with you?&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, the husband of one of
them was a farmer, that of the other was a maker of tiles.&nbsp; One
of them said, &lsquo;My husband has sown a great deal of corn; if there
is plenty of rain my husband will give me a new gown.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
other said, &lsquo;My husband is a tile-maker; he has made a great quantity;
if there is not a drop of rain he will give me a new gown.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Cogia said, &lsquo;One of you two may be worth a cucumber, but which
of the two God knows, I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia being at Siouri Castle he saw a great many people
assembled to look at the moon.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a strange land is this,&rsquo;
said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;In our country they pay no attention to
the moon when it is as big as a cart wheel, but here, when it is quite
new and of scarcely any size, what a number of people assemble to look
at it.&rsquo; <!-- page 270--><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span></p>
<p>Once as Nasr Eddin Efendi was walking in Belgrade he cried out, &lsquo;O
Lord! give me a thousand altoons, but if one be wanting I will not take
the rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now these words of the Cogia were heard by a
neighbour of his, a Jew, who, in order to try the Cogia, put nine hundred
and ninety-nine altoons into a purse and flung it down the Cogia&rsquo;s
chimney.&nbsp; The Cogia sees a purse full of money before him, up he
gets, and saying, &lsquo;Our prayer has been accepted,&rsquo; he opens
the purse, and, counting the altoons, finds that one is wanting.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;He who gives these can give
one more,&rsquo; and takes possession of the money.&nbsp; The Jew now
began to be in a fidget, and, getting up, knocked at the Cogia&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good day, Cogia Efendi,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;please
to give me back my altoons.&rsquo;&nbsp; Quoth the Cogia to the Jew,
&lsquo;You are a merchant, and not a fool; I made a request to God on
high, He gave me what I asked; what business had you to fling altoons
to me?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Jew said, &lsquo;O Cogia of my soul, I said
I will have a jest with you.&nbsp; On hearing you say, &ldquo;If one
is wanting I will not take the rest,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;I
will see whether you will or not&rdquo;; I did it merely in jest.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Jest,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;I know nothing of jest; I
accepted the gold.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; said the Jew,
&lsquo;we will go before the Judge.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;I
will not go on foot before the Judge.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the Jew
brought the Cogia a mule.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said the Cogia,
&lsquo;but I must now have a pelisse for my back.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Jew
brought him the pelisse, and they set off to the <!-- page 271--><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>tribunal
of the Cadi.&nbsp; The Cadi asking what they came for, the Jew said,
&lsquo;This man took from me so many altoons and now he denies having
done so.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cadi looked in the Cogia&rsquo;s face, whereupon
the Cogia said, &lsquo;My Lord, I asked in prayer of the Most High a
thousand altoons, which He gave.&nbsp; On counting them, however, I
found that one was wanting, whereupon I said, &ldquo;He who gives so
many altoons will doubtless give one more,&rdquo; and I accepted them;
but, my Lord, this Jew says that the pelisse which you see on my back,
and the mule on which I am mounted, are also his.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,
assuredly, my Lord,&rsquo; said the Jew, &lsquo;for mine they are both.&rsquo;&nbsp;
No sooner had he said these words than every one cried out, &lsquo;Upon
you, you Jew rascal,&rsquo; and, rushing upon him, they broke his head
and kicked him out of the tribunal, and the Cogia was sent home to his
house in triumph, not only with the altoons but the pelisse and the
mule beside.</p>
<p>One day Cogia Efendi went to a bridal festival.&nbsp; The master
of the feast observing his old and wretched garments, paid him no consideration
whatever.&nbsp; The Cogia saw that he had no chance of notice; so going
out he hurried to his house, and putting on a splendid pelisse, returned
to the place of festival.&nbsp; No sooner did he enter the door than
the master advanced to meet him, and saying, &lsquo;Welcome, Cogia Efendi,&rsquo;
with all imaginable honour and reverence placed him at the head of the
table, and said, &lsquo;Please to eat, Lord <!-- page 272--><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>Cogia.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Forthwith the Cogia taking hold of one of the furs of his pelisse, said,
&lsquo;Welcome, my pelisse, please to eat, my lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
master looking at the Cogia with great surprise, said, &lsquo;What are
you about?&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the Cogia replied, &lsquo;It is quite
evident that all the honour paid is paid to my pelisse, so let it have
some food too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nasr Eddin Efendi going one day into a city, found the doctors of
the law eating and drinking; no sooner did they see the Cogia than they
showed him great honour, and brought him food.&nbsp; It happened that
that year was a year of famine, and the Cogia whilst eating and drinking,
said to himself, &lsquo;No doubt this city must be one in which provisions
are very cheap,&rsquo; and asked a man who was by him whether it were
not so.&nbsp; The man replied, &lsquo;Are you mad? this day is Beiram,
every one according to his means cooks meat in his house and brings
it forth, and on that account the food is plentiful.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,
my good man,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;I wish that every day was
Beiram.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Cogia Efendi led a cow to the market for sale; backwards
and forwards he led it, but was unable to sell it; presently a man advancing
to the Cogia, said, &lsquo;Why do you hold this cow in your hand without
selling it?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;I have led it about
since the morning, and notwithstanding all the fine things that I <!-- page 273--><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>have
said about it I have been unable to sell it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The individual
taking the cow from the Cogia&rsquo;s hand, began to walk it about,
exclaiming, &lsquo;Who will buy a young girl six months gone with child?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Forthwith buyers followed at his heels, and a very considerable sum
was offered.&nbsp; The Cogia, very much surprised, took the money for
the cow, and went running to his house.&nbsp; The inspectors, however,
coming, took away the Cogia&rsquo;s daughter, whereupon his wife said,
&lsquo;O Cogia, do you stay a little.&nbsp; The inspecting matrons have
been for the girl.&nbsp; I will now go to them, and will give the necessary
character, so that they will take our daughter, being satisfied with
what I say.&rsquo;&nbsp; Quoth the Cogia Efendi, &lsquo;No, no, wife,
do not open your mouth.&nbsp; I have now learnt various praises fitted
for her.&nbsp; I will go and tell them.&nbsp; Do you see how they will
be pleased with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he went to the inspecting matrons,
who, as soon as they saw him, said, &lsquo;O Cogia Efendi, what have
you to do with us matrons?&nbsp; Get you gone, and let the girl&rsquo;s
mother come.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia Efendi, &lsquo;It is not the
duty of the girl&rsquo;s mother to give information with respect to
any talents which the girl may possess.&nbsp; Whatever questions you
may have to ask with respect to the talents we may have observed, do
you ask of me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Quoth the matrons, &lsquo;Let us hear you
dilate a little on her talents.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; said
the Cogia, &lsquo;if the girl is not six months gone with child, she
is my property.&rsquo;&nbsp; The ladies on hearing this looked at each
other, and getting up went away.&nbsp; Said the Cogia&rsquo;s <!-- page 274--><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>wife,
&lsquo;O Cogia, why did you drive the matrons away by using such words
to them?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you fear, wife,&rsquo; said
the Cogia, &lsquo;if they go through the whole country they will not
find a girl of this description; so let them go and come back.&nbsp;
But to tell you the truth, if I had not praised the cow in this manner,
I should have found no purchaser for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi, as he was winding the muslin of
his turban, perceived that it was not long enough; he again tried all
he could to bring it to a point, but in vain.&nbsp; The Cogia in great
distress took the muslin, and going to the public mart, put it up to
auction.&nbsp; Whilst it was being bid for, a person came and bought
it.&nbsp; Whereupon the Cogia going softly up to him, said, &lsquo;Brother,
don&rsquo;t take that thick thing; it is too short for a turban; you
can&rsquo;t bring it to a point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day an individual coming to the Cogia said, &lsquo;Something
for my good news, Cogia Efendi.&nbsp; You have a son born to you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;If I have a son born to me,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;I owe
thanks to God, but what do I owe to you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day a man coming to the Cogia asked him for the loan of his ass.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Stay here,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;whilst I go and consult
the animal.&nbsp; If the ass is willing to be lent, I will let you have
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he went in, and after staying <!-- page 275--><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>for
a time came out and said, &lsquo;The ass is not willing, and has said
to me, &ldquo;If you lend me to others I shall overhear all the evil
things that they say of your wife.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia, mounting his ass, set off for his garden; on the
road, wanting to make water, he took off his woollen vest, and placing
it on the pack-saddle of his ass, he went aside.&nbsp; A thief coming
up took the woollen vest and ran away with it.&nbsp; The Cogia returning
saw that the vest was gone; whereupon taking the pack-saddle from the
back of the ass, he put it upon his own shoulders, and giving the ass
a cut with his whip, he said, &lsquo;You lost my vest, so I take your
saddle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi, mounting his ass, again set out;
on the way, wanting to make water, he again laid his vest upon the ass,
and went aside.&nbsp; A person who had his eye upon him, instantly seized
the vest and ran away; just at that time the ass began to bray.&nbsp;
The Cogia hearing him, shouted out, &lsquo;The ass brays: the ass cries&mdash;no
good sign.&rsquo;&nbsp; The person, however, hearing the braying and
the shouting, cast the vest upon the ground and made his escape.</p>
<p>One day Cogia Efendi, having lost his ass, inquired of a certain
individual whether he had seen him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw him,&rsquo; said
the individual, &lsquo;in a certain town, officiating as Cadi.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You say <!-- page 276--><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>true,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;I knew he would be a Cadi, for I observed when
I taught him the principles of philosophy, that his ears were not sewed
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day Nasr Eddin Efendi went to the mountain to cut wood; after
he had cut the wood he loaded his ass, and began to drive him home.&nbsp;
The Efendi&rsquo;s ass, however, would hardly move.&nbsp; A person coming
up, said, &lsquo;Put a little sal ammoniac into the --- of the ass.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Cogia finding a little sal ammoniac, put it in; whereupon the ass
began to run so quickly that the Cogia was left far behind.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
would fain see the cause of this,&rsquo; said the Cogia, and clapped
a little of the sal ammoniac to his own ---.&nbsp; No sooner had he
done so than the Cogia&rsquo;s posterior began to swell, and he set
off running so quickly that he soon got before the ass, and ran straight
home, but not being able to contain himself in the house, he ran about
it, and observing his wife, he said, &lsquo;O wife, whenever you wish
me to get me on, do you stick a little sal ammoniac in my ---.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day a man came to the house of the Cogia and asked him to lend
him his ass.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is not at home,&rsquo; replied the Cogia.&nbsp;
But it so happened that the ass began to bray within.&nbsp; &lsquo;O
Cogia Efendi,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;you say that the ass is not
at home, and there he is braying within.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What a
strange fellow you are!&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;You believe
the ass, but will not believe a grey-bearded man like me.&rsquo; <!-- page 277--><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span></p>
<p>One day the Cogia said to his wife, &lsquo;O wife, how do you know
when a man is dead?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know it by his hands and feet
being cold,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; One day as the Cogia was going to
the mountain for wood, he felt cold in his hands and feet; whereupon
he said, &lsquo;I am a dead man,&rsquo; and laid himself down at the
foot of a tree.&nbsp; Some wolves, however, coming up and beginning
to devour his ass, the Cogia shouted to the wolves from the place where
he was lying, &lsquo;The ass is dead, it seems, and not the master.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day as the Cogia was cutting wood in the mountain, a wolf, coming
up to his ass, began to devour it; but on seeing the Cogia, it took
the ass and went away.&nbsp; A man who saw what happened, cried out,
&lsquo;There he goes!&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the Cogia said, &lsquo;Hallo,
man: why do you cry out?&nbsp; You must not hinder a wolf who has dined
from mounting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day as the Cogia was conducting his ass to the market, the tail
of the animal becoming draggled with mud, the Cogia cut it off and put
it into a sack.&nbsp; Arriving at the market, he put up the ass to auction;
and on a person crying out, &lsquo;What is the use of this tailless
creature?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you leave your tail in
the desert when you come to market?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day as the Cogia was coming from a distant place, his ass chanced
to be very thirsty, when <!-- page 278--><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>all
of a sudden they arrived at the margin of a pool.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
however, the sides of the pool were very steep, and the ass of the Cogia,
on seeing the water, not being able to restrain himself, ran forward
to the pool.&nbsp; Just as he was falling in, the frogs of the pool
began to croak violently; their voices frightening the ass, he ran back.&nbsp;
The Cogia, however, seized hold of him, and exclaiming, &lsquo;Bravo,
ye birds of the pool!&rsquo; he took out a handful of aspres, and flung
them into the pool, saying, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s something for sweetmeats:
take and eat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the time of Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi, three priests, who showed
themselves versed in every kind of learning, travelling through the
world, at last came to the country of the Soldan Ala Eddin.&nbsp; The
Emperor invited them to accept the true faith; whereupon the three said,
&lsquo;Each one of us has a question to ask, and if you can give us
an answer, we will adopt your religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; All agreed to this
condition; and Soldan Ala Eddin having assembled his ulemas and sheiks,
not one of them was able to make any reply to the questions of the strangers.&nbsp;
The Soldan Ala Eddin was very much incensed and mortified, and exclaimed,
&lsquo;So there is not one of the ulemas and sheiks in the countries
beneath my jurisdiction who can answer these fellows.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon
one of the ulemas replied, &lsquo;Though none of us can answer these
questions, perhaps Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi can.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Emperor,
on hearing these words, gave orders to his Tartar <!-- page 279--><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>messengers
to go in quest of Nasr Eddin Efendi.&nbsp; The Tartars, with all imaginable
speed, went their way, and having found the Cogia, communicated to him
the commands of the Sultan.&nbsp; Nasr Eddin, that moment saddling his
ass, took his staff in his hand, and mounting the animal, said to the
Tartar, &lsquo;Lead the way and set off straight for the palace of Soldan
Ala Eddin.&rsquo;&nbsp; On his arrival, he went into the presence of
the Emperor, to whom he said, &lsquo;Salaam,&rsquo; and received the
same salutation from the Sultan, who, pointing out a place to him, bade
him sit down.&nbsp; Said the Cogia to the Emperor, after wishing him
a blessing, &lsquo;For what may it have pleased you to summon me?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon the Soldan Ala Eddin told him the whole circumstance.&nbsp;
The Cogia forthwith turning to the priests said, &lsquo;What are your
questions?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then one of the priests, coming forward, said,
&lsquo;May it please your Efendiship, my question is this: &ldquo;Where
may the middle of the earth be?&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the Cogia,
instantly dismounting from his ass, pointed with his staff to the fore
foot of the ass, saying, &lsquo;The middle of the earth is the spot
on which my ass&rsquo;s foot stands.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you
know that?&rsquo; said the priest.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you doubt my words,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;take a measure and see whether it comes to more
or less.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another of the priests coming forward said, &lsquo;How
many stars are there in the face of the heaven above us?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Said the Cogia, &lsquo;As many hairs as there are upon my ass so many
stars are there in the heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo;
said the priest. <!-- page 280--><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>
&lsquo;If you doubt,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;come and count, and
if there is any difference, say at once.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you
counted, then,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;the hairs upon your ass?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And have you counted how many stars there are?&rsquo; said the
Cogia.&nbsp; Then another priest coming forward said, &lsquo;If you
can answer my question the whole of us will adopt your religion.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Speak,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;let us hear it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tell me, O Cogia,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;how many hairs
there are in this beard of mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Just as many,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;as there are hairs in my ass&rsquo;s tail.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo; said the priest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Soul of
mine,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t believe, come
and count.&rsquo;&nbsp; The priest would not consent.&nbsp; &lsquo;If
you will not consent,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;come, let us pluck
hair for hair from your beard and from the ass&rsquo;s tail and see
if they don&rsquo;t tally.&rsquo;&nbsp; The priest, seeing that he had
the worst of the argument, turned to the way of truth, and forthwith
said to his companions, &lsquo;I embrace the faith of Islam,&rsquo;
and acknowledged the unity of God.&nbsp; The two others also with heart
and soul embraced the true faith, and the whole three became servants
and disciples of the Cogia.</p>
<p>Nasr Eddin Efendi one day placed three plums upon a great table and
set out in order to carry them as a present to the Bey.&nbsp; On the
way the plums chancing to dance on this side and that the Cogia said,
&lsquo;I will now eat you until I leave one to dance by itself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So the Cogia ate two of the plums, and carrying one upon the table,
<!-- page 281--><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>placed it before
the Bey, who being very much delighted with the plum which the Cogia
brought, presented him with a great deal of money.&nbsp; The Cogia went
home, and a few days after, taking a number of beetroots, set out again
in order to carry them to the Bey.&nbsp; As he was going along he met
an individual, who said to the Cogia, &lsquo;To whom are you carrying
those things?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am carrying them to the Bey,&rsquo;
said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you were to carry him some figs instead,&rsquo;
said the individual, &lsquo;he would like it better.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Cogia instantly went and procured a few pounds of figs, which he carried
to the Bey, who ordered his attendants to fling them all at his head.&nbsp;
Some of the figs striking the Cogia&rsquo;s head, he forthwith began
to cry out, &lsquo;Thank God, thank God!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How is
this, Cogia?&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why do you thank God?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was bringing a great quantity of beetroots,&rsquo; said the
Cogia, &lsquo;but meeting an individual on the road, he advised me to
bring these instead.&nbsp; Now if I had brought beetroots, my head would
have been broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Cogia going on another day to visit the Bey, the Bey took him
out a-hunting, but mounted him on a good-for-nothing horse.&nbsp; As
they were hunting, it began to rain; every one escaped by means of his
horse, but the good-for-nothing horse would scarcely move.&nbsp; The
Cogia forthwith stripping himself naked, took his garments and sat down
upon them.&nbsp; No sooner was the rain over, than he got up, and having
dressed himself, he went to the Bey.&nbsp; Said the Bey, &lsquo;It <!-- page 282--><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>is
a wonder you escaped a wetting.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;I
was mounted on a horse that was a great goer, he flew away with me so
fast that I escaped the rain.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Bey believed every word
that he said.&nbsp; On another day the Bey again went out a-hunting,
but he now rode that same horse himself, whilst the Cogia was mounted
on another; now it so pleased God that it again began to rain, every
one escaped as fast as he could, but the Bey on the good-for-nothing
horse was left behind, and at last reached home, creeping along like
a crane.&nbsp; He was very much incensed at what the Cogia had told
him, and the next day addressed him in this manner: &lsquo;Was it fit
and proper that you should tell me the lie you did, and cause me to
be wet through by the rain which God sent?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia,
&lsquo;Why are you angry with me?&nbsp; Why had you not sense enough
to strip off your clothes as I did, and sit upon them, and when the
rain was over, dress yourself and come here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Bey sent this message to the Cogia, &lsquo;Come, I intend
to play the jerreed with you, for I wish to have a little jerreed playing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now the Cogia had an old ox, which, saddling immediately, he mounted,
and rode to the place where they played at the jerreed.&nbsp; No sooner
did the people see him than they fell to laughing, and the Bey said,
&lsquo;O Cogia, why did you mount that ox, for it can&rsquo;t run?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have seen
it when it was a calf running so fast that no horse could overtake it.&rsquo;
<!-- page 283--><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span></p>
<p>One day Tamerlank invited the Cogia to dine with him.&nbsp; The Cogia
accepted the invitation, and mounting his ass, taking the groom along
with him, set out, saying, &lsquo;Now, Tamerlank, where may you be?&rsquo;&nbsp;
When he came to the Emperor, Timour Shah, pointing to a place, bade
him sit down.&nbsp; The Cogia, seeing that Timour Shah sat with one
foot supported on a cushion, when he sat down, stretched out his own
leg, and placed it upon a corner of the cushion.&nbsp; Timour Shah being
very much offended that the Cogia stretched out his leg as he did, said
to himself, &lsquo;If I do so I have an excuse, and I am also a king&rsquo;;
and then said to the Cogia, &lsquo;When you mount your ass, what is
the difference between you and him?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia replied,
&lsquo;My Emperor, only this cushion divides us which is placed upon
his back.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Shah, perceiving the taunt, was very much
incensed, and determined to mortify the Cogia.&nbsp; The food being
brought, they began to eat, and presently Timour, without any cause,
sneezed in the Cogia&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The Cogia, when he saw Tamerlank
do this, said, &lsquo;My Emperor, is it not ill manners to do so?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is not in our country,&rsquo; said Tamerlank.&nbsp; Forthwith
the Cogia let a ---; and when Tamerlank said, &lsquo;Is not that ill
manners?&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;It is not reckoned so in our country.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The repast being over, the sherbet was brought; and then the Cogia,
getting up, set off on his way home.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did you break
wind in the presence of Timour?&rsquo; said the groom.&nbsp; Answered
the Cogia, &lsquo;When the Imam --- the assembly breaks up.&rsquo; <!-- page 284--><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span></p>
<p>One day the Cogia roasted a goose, and set out in order to carry
it to the Emperor.&nbsp; On the way, feeling very hungry, he cut off
one leg and ate it.&nbsp; Coming into the presence of the Emperor, he
placed the goose before him.&nbsp; On seeing it, Tamerlank said to himself,
&lsquo;The Cogia is making game of me,&rsquo; and was very angry, and
demanded, &lsquo;How happens it that this goose has but one foot?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Said the Cogia, &lsquo;In our country all the geese have only one foot.&nbsp;
If you disbelieve me, look at the geese by the side of that fountain.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now at that time there was a flock of geese by the rim of the fountain,
all of whom were standing on one leg.&nbsp; Timour instantly ordered
that all the drummers should at once play up; the drummers began to
strike with their sticks, and forthwith all the geese stood on both
legs.&nbsp; On Timour saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that they have
two legs?&rsquo; the Cogia replied, &lsquo;If you keep up that drumming
you yourself will presently have four.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cogia Efendi, now at rest with God, having been made Cadi, two individuals
came before him, one of whom said, &lsquo;This fellow nearly bit my
ear off.&rsquo;&nbsp; The other said, &lsquo;Not so: I did not bite
it, but he bit his own ear.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia said, &lsquo;Come
again in a little time and I will give you an answer.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
men went away, and the Cogia, going into a private place, seized hold
of his ear.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bite it,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
Then trying to rise from the ground, on which he had seated himself,
he fell back and broke a part of his head.&nbsp; Forthwith wrapping
a piece of cloth round his head, <!-- page 285--><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>he
went back and sat in his place.&nbsp; The two men coming and asking
for his decision, the Cogia said, &lsquo;No man can bite his own ear;
but, if he tries, may fall down and break his head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once as the Cogia was lying in bed, at midnight a noise was heard
in the street before the door.&nbsp; Said the Cogia to his wife, &lsquo;Get
up and light a candle, and I will go and see.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You
had better stay within,&rsquo; said his wife.&nbsp; But the Cogia, without
heeding his wife, put the counterpane on his shoulders and went out.&nbsp;
A fellow perceiving him, instantly snatched the counterpane from off
his shoulders and ran away.&nbsp; The Cogia, shivering with cold, went
in again; and when his wife asked him the cause of the noise, he said,
&lsquo;It was on account of our counterpane: when they got that the
noise ceased at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia&rsquo;s wife said to him, &lsquo;Nurse this child
for a little time, for I have a little business to see after.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Cogia, taking the child, sat with him upon his lap.&nbsp; Presently,
however, the child p--- upon the Cogia; whereupon the Cogia, getting
up, p--- over the child, from head to foot.&nbsp; His wife coming, said,
&lsquo;O Cogia, why have you acted in this manner?&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I would have --- over him,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;if he
had done so over me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia&rsquo;s wife, having washed the Cogia&rsquo;s kaftan,
hung it upon a tree to dry; the <!-- page 286--><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>Cogia
going out saw, as he supposed, a man standing in the tree with his arms
stretched out.&nbsp; Says the Cogia to his wife, &lsquo;O wife, go and
fetch me my bow and arrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; His wife fetched and brought
them to him; the Cogia taking an arrow, shot it and pierced the kaftan
and stretched it on the ground; then returning, he made fast his door
and lay down to sleep.&nbsp; Going out in the morning he saw that what
he had shot was his own kaftan; thereupon, sitting down, he cried aloud,
&lsquo;O God, be thanked; if I had been in it I should have certainly
been killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia, going to the College, mounted into the car, in
the rear of the Moolahs.&nbsp; Said the Moolahs, &lsquo;O Cogia, why
did you mount backwards?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;If I got in straightways,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;you would be at my back.&nbsp; If you went before
me your backs would be in my face, therefore I mounted in this manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One night as the Cogia was lying in his bed he perceived a thief
moving upon the housetop.&nbsp; Now, the Cogia&rsquo;s wife was lying
at his side, and he said to her, &lsquo;O wife, last night wishing to
enter the house, I repeated this prayer and descended the chimney on
the rays of the moon.&rsquo;&nbsp; The thief above heard these words
of the Cogia, and after a little time, repeating the prayer which the
Cogia had repeated, essayed to go down the chimney upon the rays of
the moon, but tumbled down headlong.&nbsp; The Cogia, who was not yet
<!-- page 287--><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>sleep, rising in
haste, seized the thief by the collar and cried out, &lsquo;O wife,
be quick and light a candle, for I have caught a thief!&rsquo; hereupon
the thief exclaimed humorously, &lsquo;O Cogia Efendi, don&rsquo;t be
in a hurry; the virtue in that prayer being in me was rather too much
for me, and so I tumbled down here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nasr Eddin Efendi had an old ox which had exceedingly great horns,
and so far apart, that it was possible for a person to sit between them.&nbsp;
Every time that the ox drew nigh the Cogia was in the habit of saying
to himself, &lsquo;How I should like to sit between his horns,&rsquo;
and calculating as to the possibility of doing so.&nbsp; One day the
ox came and laid himself down before the house.&nbsp; Cries the Cogia,
&lsquo;Now is my time!&rsquo; and mounting, he took his seat betwixt
the ox&rsquo;s two horns.&nbsp; Presently, however, the ox, rising upon
his legs, flung the Cogia upon the ground, where he lay for some time
quite senseless.&nbsp; His wife coming and seeing him lying motionless,
began to lament.&nbsp; After some time, the Cogia, recovering a little,
on seeing his wife weeping by his side, exclaimed, &lsquo;O wife, do
not weep, I have suffered a great deal, but I have had my desire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day a thief got into the Cogia&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Cries his
wife, &lsquo;O Cogia, there is a thief in the house.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
make any disturbance,&rsquo; says the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish to
God that he may find something, so that I may take it from him.&rsquo;
<!-- page 288--><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span></p>
<p>One day the Cogia&rsquo;s wife said to him, &lsquo;Go and lie down
yonder, a little way off.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia, getting up, forthwith
took his shoes in his hand, and walked during two days; at the end of
which, meeting a man, he said, &lsquo;Go and ask my wife whether I have
gone far enough, or must go yet farther.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One night as the Cogia was lying with his wife, he said, &lsquo;O
wife, if you love me, get up and light a candle, that I may write down
a verse which has come into my head.&rsquo;&nbsp; His wife, getting
up, lighted the candle, and brought him pen and inkstand.&nbsp; The
Cogia wrote, and his wife said, &lsquo;O Efendi of my soul, won&rsquo;t
you read to me what you have written?&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the Cogia
read, &lsquo;Amongst the green leaves methinks I see a black hen go
with a red bill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia being ill, a number of women came to inquire about
his health.&nbsp; One of the women said, &lsquo;God knows whether you
will die; but if you do, what shall we say when we lament over you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Say this,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;when you lament over
me, &ldquo;Notwithstanding all he did, he could never understand everything.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cogia Efendi, every time he returned to his house, was in the habit
of bringing a piece of liver, which his wife always gave to a common
woman, placing before the Cogia leavened patties to eat when he came
home in the evening.&nbsp; One <!-- page 289--><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>day
the Cogia said, &lsquo;O wife, every day I bring home a liver: where
do they all go to?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The cat runs away with all of
them,&rsquo; replied the wife.&nbsp; Thereupon the Cogia getting up,
put his hatchet in the trunk and locked it up.&nbsp; Says his wife to
the Cogia, &lsquo;For fear of whom do you lock up the hatchet?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;For fear of the cat,&rsquo; replied the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
should the cat do with the hatchet?&rsquo; said the wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo;
replied the Cogia, &lsquo;as he takes a fancy to the liver, which costs
two aspres, is it not likely that he will take a fancy to the hatchet,
which costs four?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the wife of the Cogia wanted to go to the bath.&nbsp; Now
the Cogia had a little money which he kept in a corner hid from his
wife.&nbsp; As she went out of the door she looked back.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;I am just dead, and here&rsquo;s a little money
I have left behind me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia and his wife went to the side of a pool, in order
to wash their linen.&nbsp; As they were making a beginning with their
linen by beating it upon the plain and using soap to it, a raven coming
seized the soap and flew away with it.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Cogia,&rsquo;
shrieked the wife, &lsquo;the raven has taken away the soap.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Say nothing, wife,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;it was dirty
enough after our using it; let him take it and wash it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia and his wife made an agreement to copulate every
Friday night.&nbsp; The wife <!-- page 290--><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>was
perfectly satisfied with the arrangement; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said the
Cogia, &lsquo;let us agree upon a sign by which I may know that the
time for doing my duty is come.&rsquo;&nbsp; The wife said, &lsquo;When
Friday night is come I will hang your turban above the alcove; you will
know by that that it is Friday night.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Good, good!&rsquo;
said the Cogia.&nbsp; One night, however, which was not Friday night,
the Cogia&rsquo;s wife being desirous for copulation, as soon as she
arose to go to bed, placed the Cogia&rsquo;s turban above the alcove.&nbsp;
Said the Cogia, &lsquo;O wife, this is not Friday night!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is Friday night,&rsquo; said the wife.&nbsp; Whereupon the
Cogia said, &lsquo;O wife, in this house either let Friday night keep
the reckoning, or let me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia&rsquo;s wife went with the wife of a neighbour
to wash at a pool.&nbsp; It happened that the Governor of the country,
who was taking a walk, came up and looked at them.&nbsp; Said the wife
of the Cogia, &lsquo;Pray, man, what are you looking at?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who is that woman?&rsquo; said the Governor to some one who was
standing by.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is the wife of Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi,&rsquo;
replied the individual.&nbsp; On the following day the Governor, sending
for the Cogia, said to him, &lsquo;Is such and such a woman your wife?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;she is my wife.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Said the Governor, &lsquo;Go and bring her to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What
do you want with her?&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a question
to ask her,&rsquo; said the Governor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you only tell
me the question,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;and I will go and put
it to her.&rsquo; <!-- page 291--><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span></p>
<p>One day some people said to the Cogia&rsquo;s son, &lsquo;What is
padligean?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a little deaf thing which walks
without opening its eyes,&rsquo; said the child.&nbsp; &lsquo;It did
not know that of itself: I taught it,&rsquo; said the Cogia.</p>
<p>One day a chariot departed for the Castle of Siouri.&nbsp; The Cogia
also set off for that place, running quite naked.&nbsp; The drivers,
on arriving at the town, having given information of the Cogia&rsquo;s
coming, all the people came out to meet him, who, on seeing him quite
naked, said, &lsquo;O Cogia Efendi, why do you come in this manner?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;From the love I bore you,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
was in such a hurry in dressing, that I forgot my clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Cogia had a scalt head.&nbsp; Once he went to the barber, had
his head shaved, paid an aspre, and went away.&nbsp; The following week
he went again, was shaved, and had a looking-glass placed before him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As the half of my head is scalt,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;is
not an aspre for shaving it too much by half?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia went with some men a-fishing.&nbsp; They cast the
net into the sea, and the Cogia cast himself into the net.&nbsp; &lsquo;O
Cogia,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;what are you about?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
imagined myself a fish,&rsquo; said the Cogia.</p>
<p>One day the boys of the town said to one another, &lsquo;Come, let
us get the Cogia to climb a tree, and <!-- page 292--><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>we
will steal away his sandals.&rsquo;&nbsp; The boys coming to the foot
of a tree stopped, and said, &lsquo;No one can climb this tree.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Cogia coming up, said, &lsquo;I can climb it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
you can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; Forthwith the Cogia tied the
skirts of his robe about his loins and put his sandals in his bosom.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Cogia Efendi,&rsquo; said the boys, &lsquo;what will you do
with your slippers in the tree?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;If
I find a road when I am above there, I shall have my slippers ready
to put on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day a man coming from the country brought the Cogia a hare.&nbsp;
The Cogia, with much politeness and civility, gave him some broth to
eat.&nbsp; At the end of a week he came again; but the Cogia appearing
to have forgot him, said, &lsquo;Who may you be?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am the person who brought the hare,&rsquo; said the man; whereupon the
Cogia again entertained him.&nbsp; After some days a number of men made
their appearance and wanted to be entertained.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who may
you be?&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are the neighbours of
the man who brought you the hare,&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; A few days
after a whole troop of men arriving, the Cogia asked them who they were?&nbsp;
&lsquo;We are the neighbours of the neighbours of the man who brought
the hare,&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are quite welcome,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, and placed before them a large jar of pure water; on
seeing which they said, &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The
water of the water of the hare is what it is,&rsquo; said the Cogia.
<!-- page 293--><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span></p>
<p>One day the Cogia, whilst labouring in the field, found a tortoise,
and, seizing hold of it, tied a string round its neck and hung it to
his spade.&nbsp; The tortoise beginning to cry and squeal, &lsquo;It
is of no use crying,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;you must now learn
to work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia, being on the point of death, called his neighbours
about him.&nbsp; The neighbours coming, began to eat and make merry,
without saying to the Cogia, &lsquo;Come and partake.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
Cogia incensed, got up and went out.&nbsp; After a little time they
sought for the Cogia, and could not find him; so dispersing themselves
about, they went after him, and at last found him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ho,
Cogia,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;come, where have you got to?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Said the Cogia, &lsquo;He who this day supplies the bridal meats has,
surely, a right to go into the bridal chamber.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia, being out on a journey, encamped along with a
caravan, and tied up his horse along with the others.&nbsp; When it
was morning the Cogia could not find his horse amongst the rest, not
knowing how to distinguish it; forthwith taking a bow and arrow in his
hand, he said, &lsquo;Men, men, I have lost my horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every
one laughing, took his own horse; and the Cogia looking, saw a horse
which he instantly knew to be his own.&nbsp; Forthwith placing his right
foot in the stirrup, he mounted the horse, so that his face looked to
the horse&rsquo;s tail.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Cogia,&rsquo; <!-- page 294--><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>said
they, &lsquo;why do you mount the horse the wrong way?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is not my fault,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but the horse&rsquo;s,
for the horse is left-handed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Cogia had a disciple, who was an Abyssinian, black, of the name
of Hamet.&nbsp; One day Hamet having inadvertently broken a bottle of
ink over the Cogia, &lsquo;What is this, Cogia?&rsquo; said the others.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think a few good kicks would be a useful lesson
to our Hamet?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Let him be.&nbsp; He got into a sweat
by running,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;and melted over me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia having mounted up into the pulpit, said, &lsquo;O
Mussulmen, I have a piece of advice to give you.&nbsp; If you have sons,
take care that you do not give them the name of Ei&iuml;oub (Job).&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why, O Cogia?&rsquo; cried the people.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lest the
quality should accompany the name,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;and they
should all become ips (ropes).&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day as the Cogia was performing ablution, he found he had not
sufficient water.&nbsp; When the hour of prayer came on, he stood like
a goose on one foot.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Cogia Efendi,&rsquo; said the people,
&lsquo;why do you do so?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said the
Cogia, &lsquo;this foot has not performed ablution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day a man arriving, became the guest of the Cogia.&nbsp; It happened
at night, some time after they had lain down, that the light went out.
<!-- page 295--><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span> &lsquo;O Cogia Efendi,&rsquo;
said the guest, &lsquo;the taper is gone out.&nbsp; But there is a taper
on your right side; pray bring it, and let us light it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Surely you must be a fool,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
should I know my right side in the dark?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day they said to the Cogia, &lsquo;Pray what may be your horoscope?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Said the Cogia, &lsquo;I was born under the sign of the He-goat.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Cogia,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;there is no such sign as the
He-goat.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;When I was a child my mother
had my horoscope taken, and at that time the Kid was in the ascension.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;O Cogia,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all right; but
a kid is one thing and a he-goat is another.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia,
&lsquo;O you simpletons!&nbsp; Forty or fifty years have passed since
then.&nbsp; Must not the kid have become an old goat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day whilst the Cogia was holding an oration at the Castle of
Siouri, he was contradicted by the Soubashi or Superintendent.&nbsp;
Shortly after, it happened that the Soubashi died and was buried; whereupon
they said, &lsquo;Come, Efendi, preach a sermon over him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You must find some one else,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
won&rsquo;t mind my words, for he always contradicts me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day two men were sitting together in a shop before their houses,
engaged in discourse.&nbsp; Their houses abutted upon each other, and
it so happened that a dog came and deposited his dirt on the ground
in the middle of the street before <!-- page 296--><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>their
houses.&nbsp; Said one, &lsquo;It is nigh your house.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nay,
my good friend,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;it is nearest to your
house, so you must go and take it up.&rsquo;&nbsp; So they got into
a dispute; and not being able to settle it, they went before the Tribunal.&nbsp;
Now it happened that the Cogia had come that day to pay a visit to the
Cadi, and sat beside him.&nbsp; Said the Cadi to the Cogia, &lsquo;Do
you decide upon their dispute.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the Cogia said
to them, &lsquo;Is not that street a public way?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is,&rsquo; said they.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;one
half of the perfumery belongs to you two and the other half to the Cadi.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia put a yoke upon a calf which he had; the calf ran
here and there.&nbsp; Forthwith the Cogia, seizing a stick, fell to
banging his ox.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Cogia,&rsquo; said the people, &lsquo;why
do you beat the ox; how can he be in fault?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;All
the fault is his,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;if he had taught him
the calf would have known how to turn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day as the Cogia was travelling in the Derbend he met a shepherd.&nbsp;
Said the shepherd to the Cogia, &lsquo;Art thou a faquir?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Cogia.&nbsp; Said the shepherd, &lsquo;See
these seven men who are lying here, they were men like you whom I killed
because they could not answer questions which I asked.&nbsp; Now, in
the first place let us come to an understanding; if you can answer my
questions let us hold discourse, if not, let us say nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Says the Cogia, &lsquo;What <!-- page 297--><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>may
your questions be?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the shepherd, &lsquo;The moon,
when it is new, is small, afterwards it increases, until it looks like
a wheel; after the fifteenth, it diminishes, and does not remain; then
again, there is a little one, of the size of Hilal, which does remain.&nbsp;
Now what becomes of the old moons?&rsquo;&nbsp; Says the Cogia, &lsquo;How
is it that you don&rsquo;t know a thing like that?&nbsp; They take those
old moons and make lightning of them; have you not seen them when the
heaven thunders, glittering like so many swords?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Bravo,
Faquir,&rsquo; said the shepherd.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well art thou acquainted
with the matter, I had come to the same conclusion myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nasr Eddin Efendi, now with God, had a sum of money.&nbsp; One day,
when all was quiet in the house, he dug in the earth and buried it;
then going to the door he looked out and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll suppose
myself a thief, and that I find this, and forthwith take it away and
bury it in another place, and my heart is no more troubled about it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thus saying, he came and took up his treasure.&nbsp; Now before the
house there was a height, and the Cogia going to the garden of the house,
cut a pole, and putting the money in a sack, tied the sack to the top
of the pole, and bringing the pole, stuck it up on the top of the height;
then going down he looked upwards and said, &lsquo;Unless a man is a
bird he cannot fly up to that, I have surely chosen a good place,&rsquo;
and having said this, he went away.&nbsp; Now it happened that a thief
saw all that Cogia <!-- page 298--><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>did,
and no sooner was the Cogia gone, than he climbed up the height and
took down the money, and putting upon the top of the pole a quantity
of bullock&rsquo;s dung, he stuck up the pole again and went his way.&nbsp;
Some time afterwards the Cogia being in need of money, came to the foot
of the pole and saw that all the money was gone, and that a quantity
of bullock&rsquo;s dung was on the pole.&nbsp; Said he, &lsquo;I said
that no man could mount this pole and take away the money, but how bullock&rsquo;s
dung should get to the top of the pole is a very strange matter indeed.&nbsp;
So,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;may the Lord have mercy upon him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day as the Cogia was going to his house, he met a number of students,
and said to them, &lsquo;Gentlemen, pray this night come to our house
and taste a sup of the old father&rsquo;s broth.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Very
good,&rsquo; said the students, and following the Cogia, came to the
house.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray enter,&rsquo; said he, and brought them into
the house; then going up to where his wife was, &lsquo;O wife,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;I have brought some travellers that we may give them
a cup of broth.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;O master,&rsquo; said his wife,
&lsquo;is there oil in the house or rice, or have you brought any that
you wish to have broth?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Bless me,&rsquo; said the
Cogia, &lsquo;give me the broth pan,&rsquo; and snatching it up, he
forthwith ran to where the students were, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Pray,
pardon me, gentlemen, but had there been oil or rice in our house, this
is the pan in which I would have served the broth up to you.&rsquo;
<!-- page 299--><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span></p>
<p>One day the Cogia going into the kitchen of his house, laid himself
down; presently the Cogia&rsquo;s daughter entering into the kitchen
to fetch something, saw her father lying hidden behind a cask.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O my lord and father, what do you do here?&rsquo; said she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What could I better do to get out of your mother&rsquo;s way
than come into this foreign country,&rsquo; said the Cogia.</p>
<p>One day when the Cogia was in his chamber, a man knocked at the door
of the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; said the Cogia from
above.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come down,&rsquo; said the man, who was a beggar.&nbsp;
The Cogia forthwith came down and said, &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I want your charity,&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come upstairs,&rsquo;
said the Cogia.&nbsp; When the beggar had come up, the Cogia said, &lsquo;God
help you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;O master,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;why
did you not say so below?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;When I
was above stairs, why did you bring me down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once upon a time the wife of the Cogia was in labour; one day, two
days, she sat upon the chair but could not bring forth; the women who
attended her cried from the interior apartment to the Cogia: &lsquo;O
master, do you know no prayer by means of which the child may be brought
into the world?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know a specific,&rsquo; said the
Cogia, and forthwith running to a grocer&rsquo;s shop he procured some
walnuts, and bringing them he said, &lsquo;Make way,&rsquo; and going
into the room he spread the walnuts under the <!-- page 300--><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>chair,
and said: &lsquo;Now that the child sees the walnuts he will come out
to play with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia&rsquo;s wife, in order to plague the Cogia, boiled
some broth exceedingly hot, brought it into the room and placed it on
the table.&nbsp; The wife then, forgetting that it was hot, took a spoon
and put some into her mouth, and, scalding herself, began to shed tears.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O wife,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;what is the matter with
you; is the broth hot?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear Efendi,&rsquo; said
the wife, &lsquo;my mother, who is now dead, loved broth very much;
I thought of that, and wept on her account.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia thinking
that what she said was truth, took a spoonful of the broth, and burning
his mouth began to cry and bellow.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the matter with
you?&rsquo; said his wife; &lsquo;why do you cry?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said
the Cogia, &lsquo;You cry because your mother is gone, but I cry because
her daughter is here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia&rsquo;s wife went to the hall of preaching; and,
after listening to the sermon, came home.&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;O
wife, what did the preacher say?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He said,&rsquo;
replied the wife, &lsquo;that if any one has a night&rsquo;s copulation
with his lawful wife the Almighty God will build for him a mansion in
paradise.&rsquo;&nbsp; After they had gone to bed the Cogia said, &lsquo;Come,
let us build a house in paradise.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon they copulated.&nbsp;
Shortly afterwards the wife said, &lsquo;O Cogia, you have built a house
for yourself, pray now build a house <!-- page 301--><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>for
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;I could easily build a house
for you, but I fear that I should have to build houses for your father
and mother, and not only for them, but for all your family and relations,
so that the Master Builder above would become angry.&nbsp; Come, one
house must suffice for us two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia met a company of young students and said unto them,
&lsquo;Pray come along with me to our house.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he led
them to the door of the house and then said, &lsquo;Pray stay here a
little, whilst I go in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then going in he said, &lsquo;O
wife, pray go and send those people away.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the
wife went and said, &lsquo;The Cogia is not come home.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Said the students, &lsquo;What do you mean by talking so?&nbsp; The
Cogia came hither in our company.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He did not come,&rsquo;
said the wife.&nbsp; &lsquo;But he did,&rsquo; said the students, and
made a great outcry.&nbsp; The Cogia hearing a noise from above, thrust
his head out of the window, exclaiming, &lsquo;Holloa, my men: what
is all this dispute for?&nbsp; You must know that this house has two
doors.&nbsp; No sooner did I come in by one than I left the house by
the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the son of the Cogia said, &lsquo;O Father, I know that I
was begotten by you.&rsquo;&nbsp; His mother becoming very angry, said,
&lsquo;What nonsense is the brat talking that he calls himself the son
of a whore?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia, &lsquo;O wife, don&rsquo;t
be <!-- page 302--><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>angry, he is a
wise son if he knows what he says he does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once on a time there was a drunken Governor of Siouri Castle.&nbsp;
It happened one day that he lay in a state of drunkenness in the garden;
and the Cogia taking a walk in the garden with Amad, came up and found
him lying drunk and insensible.&nbsp; The Cogia instantly stripped him
of his feradje or upper coat, and putting it on his own back, walked
away.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Governor, on getting up, saw that
he had lost his feradje, and going to his officers gave them the following
command, &lsquo;Whomsoever you find with my feradje upon him, lay hold
on and bring him before me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The officials seeing the feradje
on the back of the Cogia, made him their prisoner, and brought him before
the Governor, who said to him, &lsquo;Ho, Cogia, where did you find
that feradje?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;As I was taking a walk with Amad,&rsquo;
said the Cogia, &lsquo;we saw a fellow lying drunk; whereupon Amad twice
uncovered his breech, and I, taking off his feradje, went away with
it.&nbsp; If it is yours, pray take it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh no, it
does not belong to me,&rsquo; said the Governor.</p>
<p>One day the Cogia having lain down to sleep on the bank of a river
imagined himself dead.&nbsp; An individual coming up said, &lsquo;I
wonder where one could cross this water.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the Cogia,
&lsquo;When I was alive I crossed over here, but now I can&rsquo;t tell
you where you should cross.&rsquo; <!-- page 303--><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span></p>
<p>One day a Persian barber was shaving the Cogia&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
At every stroke of his razor he cut his head, and to every place which
he cut he applied a piece of cotton.&nbsp; Said the Cogia to the barber,
&lsquo;My good fellow, you had better sow half of my head with cotton
and let me sow the other half with flax.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One time the Cogia went to the well to draw water, but seeing the
face of the moon reflected in the well, he exclaimed, &lsquo;The moon
has fallen into the well, I must pull it out.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then going
home, he took a rope and hook, and returning, cast it into the well,
where the hook became fastened against a stone.&nbsp; The Cogia, exerting
all his might, pulled at the rope, once, twice, but at the second pulling
the rope snapped, and he fell upon his back, and looking up into the
heaven, saw the moon, whereupon he exclaimed, &lsquo;O praise and glory,
I have suffered much pain, but the moon has got to its place again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One day the Cogia going into a person&rsquo;s garden climbed up into
an apricot-tree and began to eat the apricots.&nbsp; The master coming
said, &lsquo;Cogia, what are you doing here?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear
me,&rsquo; said the Cogia, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you see that I am a nightingale
sitting in the apricot-tree?&rsquo;&nbsp; Said the gardener, &lsquo;Let
me hear you sing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Cogia began to warble.&nbsp; Whereupon
the other fell to laughing, and said, &lsquo;Do you call that singing?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am a Persian nightingale,&rsquo; said <!-- page 304--><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>the
Cogia, &lsquo;and Persian nightingales sing in this manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Cogia, now with God, was master of all learning, and perfect
in every art.&nbsp; If some people should now say, &lsquo;We were in
hope of receiving instruction from his sayings, but have read nothing
but the ravings of madness&rsquo;; and if they should require some other
book of his utterances, we must tell them that he uttered nothing beyond
what is noted here.&nbsp; Some people say that, whilst uttering what
seemed madness, he was, in reality, divinely inspired, and that it was
not madness but wisdom that he uttered.&nbsp; The mercy of God be upon
him, mercy without bounds.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
